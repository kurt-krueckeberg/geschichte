=== Possilbe Route to Fort Wayne

The Erie Canal route to Fort Wayne was available was both available and common in 1850, and
it’s very plausible your family used it.

Here’s how it would have worked, step-by-step:

[arabic]
. *New York City → Albany (Hudson River steamboat).* Immigrants
typically boarded a fast Hudson River steamer up to Albany after landing
in NYC. This was a well-established leg by mid-century. ([WIRED][1])
. *Albany → Buffalo (Erie Canal packet).* From Albany they could take
the Erie Canal west to Buffalo (the canal had linked Albany–Buffalo
since 1825). Canal travel by immigrant "`packet`" was routine in the
1825–early-1850s period. ([Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor][2])
. *Buffalo → Toledo (Lake Erie steamer).* From Buffalo, a lake steamer
along Lake Erie to the Toledo/Maumee area was the normal connection
toward Indiana and Ohio canal points. Contemporary accounts describe
this as the next leg after the Erie Canal.
([fillmorecountyjournal.com][3])
. *Toledo/Maumee Valley → Fort Wayne (Wabash & Erie route).* The Wabash
& Erie Canal reached Fort Wayne well before 1850 and, in its northern
section, shared the Maumee River corridor with the Miami & Erie Canal as
far as Junction, Ohio; from there the Wabash & Erie continued west to
Fort Wayne. The Toledo-to-Lafayette section was celebrated/open by 1843,
making a continuous water route from Lake Erie to Fort Wayne available.
([Wabash and Erie Canal][4])

== A timing note for *November 19, 1850*

New York canals typically closed for winter from late November into
early December, so an arrival on November 19 was late but still within
the usual navigation window; they likely had to move quickly, and
weather on Lake Erie could be dicey. ([USGS Publications Warehouse][5])

== Possible alternative (also plausible in 1850)

By late 1850 there was already *through railroad service across New York
State* (Albany ↔ Buffalo via consolidated lines), which some travelers
began to use because it was faster than the canal; from Buffalo they
would still switch to a Lake Erie steamer toward Toledo and then the
canal into Fort Wayne. (The separate Erie Railroad to Dunkirk on Lake
Erie opened in May 1851.) ([Penelope][6])

*Bottom line:* Your proposed path—Hudson steamer to Albany → Erie Canal
to Buffalo → Lake steamer to Toledo/Maumee → Wabash & Erie Canal to Fort
Wayne—is exactly the classic mid-century immigrant route to northeastern
Indiana, and it fits both the infrastructure and the season for late
1850. ([Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor][2])
