# Other **non-church** record groups for Petzen/Amt Bückeburg that can help sort Krückeberg
households in **Berenbusch (c. 1725–1750)**.

 Below are the ones most likely to exist for **Schaumburg-Lippe** at
NLA Bückeburg (and why they help), in rough order of payoff.

## Most promising (land/tax/household identity)

1. **Kontributions- & Schatzungsregister (tax rolls)**
   Annual/periodic lists of taxpayers by village/Status (Colon, Anbauer/Brinksitzer, Einwohner). Often note a head of household and sometimes predecessors (“jetzt …, zuvor …”).
   ➜ Lets you see **which Krückeberg heads** (Johann Heinrich, Jobst, etc.) paid in Berenbusch and their **status**—perfect to split children by household.

2. **Lager-/Hof-/Meier-Register (Rentkammer house & land books)**
   Estate/lease registers for each **Kolon/Meierhof**: tenant’s name, obligations, acreages, transfers.
   ➜ Ties a **named Krückeberg** to a **specific holding**; later entries often back-reference earlier tenants (useful even if the exact year is a bit later than 1750).

3. **Hof-, Kauf-, Tausch-, Übergabe- & Meierbriefe (property/tenure charters)**
   Deeds/leases when a farm or part of it changed hands; include **giver/receiver, kin, witnesses**.
   ➜ Identifies **fathers/sons** and the **house succession**, anchoring which adult Krückeberg fathered which cohort.

4. **Altenteil/Leibzucht contracts (retirement portion)**
   When an elder cedes the farm to the heir; lists **spouses, parents, children**, and support owed.
   ➜ Names the **heir** and often the **spouse’s family** (Vahlsing links possible).

# Civil & court material (relationship clues)

5. **Inventare & Teilungen / Testamente / Vormundschaftsakten**
   Post-death inventories and partitions; guardianship for minors.
   ➜ Enumerate **children by name and age** and explicitly state **father/mother**—gold for assigning the 1730s–1740s births.

6. **Untergerichts-/Amtsprotokolle (local court minutes)**
   Routine village cases, acknowledgements, loans, sureties.
   ➜ Put **two Krückeberg men** in the same entry with relationships (brother, neighbor, son-in-law).

# Military & obligations (heads of household lists)

7. **Landmiliz Muster- & Steuerrollen / Rekrutierungslisten**
   Militia or recruiting lists by village/status.
   ➜ Name **eligible males** with residence; good to see **Jobst vs. Johann Heinrich** alive in specific years.

8. **Frondienst-/Hand- & Spanndienst-Verzeichnisse**
   Labor and draft-team obligations (who turns up for road/estate work).
   ➜ Confirms **which Krückeberg** held a team (often only the colon) vs. which were smallholders.

## Fiscal/administrative byplaces (sometimes earlier/later but useful)

9. **Brandkasse (fire-insurance) registers** *(often mid-18th c. +)*
   House lists with **owner/tenant**, construction details, valuations.
   ➜ Even if a tad later, entries frequently say **“jetzt …, vor diesem …”**, linking back to your timeframe.

10. **Forst- und Holzlisten / Weide- & Hude-Register**
    Rights to wood/pasture allocated by household.
    ➜ Another way to separate households in a village with few surnames.

## How to use them fast and surgically

* **Search scope**: NLA Bückeburg → series for **Amt Bückeburg / Rentkammer (Kammer- und Domänenverwaltung)** and **Untergericht Bückeburg**. Ask/scan for Ortsregister/Findbücher keywords: **Berenbusch, Kontribution, Schatzung, Lagerbuch, Meier, Hofbrief, Altenteil, Inventar, Vormundschaft, Militär/Milice, Brandkasse**.
* **Extraction grid** for each hit: `Year • Record type • Village • Status (Colon/Anbauer) • Name (exact) • House/holding note • Kin mentioned • Predecessor/Successor`.
* **Goal**: Prove **≥2 simultaneous Krückeberg heads** in Berenbusch and attach **Vahlsing** ties where they appear (e.g., witness “N.N. Vahlsing” on a lease/Altenteil).
* **Then** map baptisms to the correct head via **Status** and **time overlap** (e.g., children labeled “Colon Krückeberg” vs “Anbauer Krückeberg” or overlapping with a father proven alive in a specific year).

If you want, tell me which of these series you can access first (Rentkammer tax rolls vs. court inventories), and I’ll draft a **1-page pull list** with the exact search terms (German archive phrasing) you can hand the archivist to retrieve volumes for **Berenbusch, 1725–1750 (+ buffer to 1760)**.
