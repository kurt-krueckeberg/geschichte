## Question Concerning Parentage of Krückeberg Children Born 1728-1750

A prospective ancestor of mine named Johann Heinrich Krückeberg from
Berenbusch in Schaumburg-Lippe married his wife, Anna Maria Vahlsing, on
September 28, 1727. The couple remained married to one another until
their deaths. They had at least one child, and may have had more.
However, the birth/baptism records state only the family name. After
giving the given name of the child and the date of its baptism (and
possibly the day of their birth), the baptism records for this time
period state they were born to \"Krückeberg aus Berenbusch\". IT does
not give the father'ss first name nor the mother's first name. I realize
that the Lutheran church records of Petzen, which was their parish,
lists births/baptisms, confirmations, marriages and deaths/funerals; but
that these records do not constitute census records; that is, they only
list individuals who participated in the church ceremonies that the
church registers for Petzen record. A Krückeberg couple, for example,
who was already married elsewhere than the Petzen parish may have come
to live in Berenbusch---besides Johann Heinrich Krückeberg and his wife.
We know a number of Krückeberg children were born between 1728 and 1750.
But like I mentioned, only the surname is given in the birth/baptism
record. However, for only one of the children, Johann Wilhelm
Krückeberg, who was born in 1739 and died in 1747, do we know the
father's first name. The death record for Johann Wilhlm Krückeberg gives
his father as Johann Heinrich Krückeberg. We know from the death record
60 years later than the father of one Krückeberg child born during the
1728 to 1750 time frame was Jobst Krückeberg. This is issue is this:
Someone has assigned as parents in the FamilySearch tree all the
Krückeberg children---except the one clearly born to Jobst
Krückeberg---to the Johann Heinrich and Anna Maria. But this results in
a very, very unusual pattern of childbirths to this couple. The pattern
of childbirths is given in the AsciiDoc table immediately below where
the first column is the child's name, the 2nd column is the month of
birth (given as \"unknown\" if it is not known), and the third column is
the year of birth:

The pattern of births has a gap of 8 years between the first and 2nd
child. Furthermore, the mother was born in 1701. So it does not seem
credible that she would have three children born while she was in her
40s and that one child would be born. Furthermore, she died at age 57.

I can't believe this was a typically pattern of childbirths for this
time frame, and I find it hard to believe that in any era a couple would
have three children when the wife was in her forties, with the first of
these born when she was around 43, the next when she was 45 and the last
when she was 49.

What can be definitely concluded as to the parentage of the children
(other than Johann Wilhelm Krückeberg) from this pattern of births and
the facts.

## Analysis

Short answer: other than Johann **Wilhelm** (bapt. Feb 1739, bur. 1747, explicitly “son of **Johann Heinrich** Krückeberg”), the rest cannot be **safely** assigned to Johann Heinrich & Anna Maria Vahlsing from the pattern alone.

Here’s why—clearly and conservatively:

* **Only one direct link.** The 1747 burial of Johann *Wilhelm* names his father **Johann Heinrich**. That proves one parent–child link. The baptisms that say only “Krückeberg aus Berenbusch” don’t prove *which* Krückeberg couple.
* **Birth spacing is atypical for a single mother.** If Anna Maria was b. **1701**, her ages at the listed births would be:
  1728 (**27**), 1736 (**35**), 1739 (**38**), 1744 (**43**), 1746 (**45**), ~1750 (**49**).
  Three births in the mid-/late-40s **after** an eight-year gap (1728→1736) strongly suggests **more than one Krückeberg couple** bearing children in Petzen parish during 1728–1750. It’s not impossible biologically, but it’s **unusual** for this region/era unless there’s a second mother or a re-marriage—neither of which you assert for Johann Heinrich & Anna Maria (you say they stayed married).
* **Documented second father exists.** You already have evidence that **one child’s father was Jobst Krückeberg** (from a later death record). That alone proves the register phrase “Krückeberg aus Berenbusch” refers to **multiple fathers**, not exclusively Johann Heinrich.
* **Therefore the FamilySearch assignments are speculative.** Rolling every “Krückeberg aus Berenbusch” child (except Jobst’s) under Johann Heinrich & Anna Maria creates an implausible pattern and exceeds the evidence.

### What you can conclude now (definitively)

1. **Johann Wilhelm** (1739–1747) = child of **Johann Heinrich** Krückeberg (mother not named in that death entry, but by marriage context presumed Anna Maria Vahlsing).
2. At least **two** Krückeberg nuclear families were producing children in Berenbusch, Petzen parish, 1728–1750 (one headed by **Johann Heinrich**, another by **Jobst**; a third cannot be ruled out).

### What you **cannot** conclude (yet)

* You **cannot** assign Johann Friedrich (1728), Dorothea Elisabeth (1736), Johann Heinrich (1744), Anna Louisa Eleonora (1746), or Carl (~1750) to Johann Heinrich & Anna Maria **without an explicit record naming a parent** beyond “Krückeberg aus Berenbusch.”

### How to sort the children properly (practical next steps that usually work in Petzen-era books)

Use records that **do** name parents or tie to a specific household:

1. **Confirmations** (usually at ~14): entries often add “Sohn/Tochter des [father] in Berenbusch.”

   * Targets: 1742 (for 1728 birth), ~1750 (for 1736), ~1753 (for 1739), ~1758 (for 1744), ~1760 (for 1746), ~1764 (for c.1750).
2. **Burials of children/teens** (like the 1747 Wilhelm case): under-age burials often name the father.
3. **Later marriages** of these children: Petzen marriage entries in the 1750s–1770s often name the **bride/groom’s father** and residence.
4. **Communicant / household (Beichtkinder) lists** if Petzen kept them in the 1740s–1750s—these group family members under the householder’s name.
5. **Berenbusch colon/house numbers** in later records (confirmations, tax, militia lists, or land registers): if you can link a child to **Colon Nr. X**, and tie Johann Heinrich or Jobst to that same number in the same decade, the family grouping usually snaps into place.
6. **Godparent networks**: map sponsors across the Krückeberg entries. Distinct sponsor clusters often reveal which children belong to the **Johann Heinrich** household vs. the **Jobst** household.
7. **Mother’s burial** (Anna Maria Vahlsing, d. ~age 57): sometimes mentions “widow of…” and occasionally a residence or surviving children—any clue helps.

### What to do on FamilySearch (to avoid misleading trees)

* Keep **Johann Wilhelm (1739–1747)** under **Johann Heinrich** & **Anna Maria**.
* For the other children, change parents to **“Unknown Krückeberg couple of Berenbusch”** (create a placeholder couple if needed) **until** you find a confirmation, burial, or marriage naming the father.
* Attach a **Research Note**: explain that Petzen baptisms name only “Krückeberg aus Berenbusch” and that at least two fathers (Johann Heinrich, Jobst) are attested for this period; therefore, unproven children are parked with an “Unknown Krückeberg (Berenbusch)” couple pending identification.

### Likely synthesis (working hypothesis—not proof)

* **Johann Friedrich (1728)** could be **Johann Heinrich’s** first child (mother age 27) *or* belong to another Krückeberg couple already present in Berenbusch.
* The **1736–1746** run probably mixes children of **Johann Heinrich** and **Jobst** (and possibly a third Krückeberg), which explains the “late” cluster without forcing a single mother to bear three children 43–49.

If you want, tell me which of these children you’ve already checked for **confirmation entries** or **marriage entries**, and I’ll draft a tight lookup plan (by exact years and book sections) to pin each to the correct father.
