**Castle Garden (Castle Clinton) didn’t become an immigration depot until August 3, 1855.** So arrivals in
**1849–1850** were **not processed or landed at Castle Garden**. ([National Park Service][1])

In that period, ships **first stopped at the Staten Island Marine Hospital (the Quarantine)** for inspection,
then—once cleared—**proceeded to Manhattan piers**, especially along **South Street on the East River**, where
passengers disembarked directly to the wharf. ([Wikipedia][2])

Yes—**as a rule in 1849–1850, all ocean-arriving vessels were required to stop at the Staten Island Quarantine for
health inspection** before proceeding to Manhattan. New York’s quarantine system had been in place since 1799 at
the **New York Marine Hospital** (“the Quarantine”) on Staten Island, and by the mid-19th century ships from
foreign ports were inspected there as a matter of law and practice. ([National Lighthouse Museum][1])

A concise summary from a museum history notes that **“by 1846 all ships coming into New York Harbor had to anchor
off near Staten Island for quarantine inspection.”** That matches the legal framework referenced in period court
discussions (e.g., *Smith v. Turner*, 1849) about New York’s marine hospital and quarantine authority. ([THE
WHALING MUSEUM][2])

Also, **Castle Garden did not open as an immigrant landing/processing depot until August 3, 1855**, i.e., several
years after your ancestors’ 1849–1850 arrivals—so their ships would have cleared Staten Island Quarantine and then
docked at Manhattan piers (typically the East River) rather than landing at Castle Garden. ([National Park
Service][3])

**Bottom line:** For arrivals from Bremerhaven in **1849–1850**, you can safely infer **Staten Island Quarantine first**, followed by docking at a Manhattan wharf.

So if your ancestors came in **1849–1850** , they likely cleared **Staten Island Quarantine** and then **walked off
at a Manhattan pier**, not by tender at Castle Garden.

What actually happened then:

* **Quarantine first.** Arriving ships anchored off **Staten Island’s Marine Hospital (the Quarantine)**, where
  health officers boarded for inspection. Only after clearance could a ship proceed toward Manhattan. ([Lighthouse Museum][1])
* **No central immigration station yet.** **Castle Garden wasn’t an immigrant depot until August 3, 1855**; before
  that, it was an entertainment venue. So in 1849–1850 there was **no landing at Castle Garden for processing**. ([National Park Service][2])
* **They docked at Manhattan piers (mostly South Street on the East River).** After quarantine, packet ships
  typically **tied up at the South Street Seaport piers** (or nearby East River wharves), and passengers **walked
  off onto the wharf**; ship agents handled any onward arrangements. Tendering was only used when circumstances
  required, not as a standard practice at Castle Garden. ([South Street Seaport Museum][3])
* **“From Bremen” usually meant Bremerhaven.** Most Bremen sailings actually embarked at **Bremerhaven** (the
  outport on the Weser), though U.S. lists often just say “Bremen.” ([GG Archives][4])

So for your ancestors in **1849–1850**: cleared quarantine off **Staten Island**, then **docked at Manhattan (South
Street/East River)** and disembarked there—not by small boats from Castle Garden.
