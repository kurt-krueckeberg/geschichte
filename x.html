<h1>Immigrant Ship Arrivals Prior to 1855</h1>
<h2>Arrival Place and Process pre-1855</h2>
<p><strong>Castle Garden (Castle Clinton) didn’t become an immigration depot until August 3, 1855.</strong> So arrivals in
<strong>1849–1850</strong> were <strong>not processed or landed at Castle Garden</strong>. (<a href="https://lighthousemuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matt-Connor-Quarantine-NY-Article-555KBwecompress.com_.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Quarantine in New York: A Historical Context">National Park Service</a>)</p>
<p>In that period, ships <strong>first stopped at the Staten Island Marine Hospital (the Quarantine)</strong> for inspection,
then—once cleared—<strong>proceeded to Manhattan piers</strong>, especially along <strong>South Street on the East River</strong>, where
passengers disembarked directly to the wharf. (<a href="https://www.cshwhalingmuseum.org/blog/the-history-of-quarantine-in-new-york-harbor-and-long-island?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="The HISTORY OF Quarantine in New York Harbor and ...">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>Yes—<strong>as a rule in 1849–1850, all ocean-arriving vessels were required to stop at the Staten Island Quarantine for
health inspection</strong> before proceeding to Manhattan. New York’s quarantine system had been in place since 1799 at
the <strong>New York Marine Hospital</strong> (“the Quarantine”) on Staten Island, and by the mid-19th century ships from
foreign ports were inspected there as a matter of law and practice. (<a href="https://lighthousemuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matt-Connor-Quarantine-NY-Article-555KBwecompress.com_.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Quarantine in New York: A Historical Context">National Lighthouse Museum</a>)</p>
<p>A concise summary from a museum history notes that <strong>“by 1846 all ships coming into New York Harbor had to anchor
off near Staten Island for quarantine inspection.”</strong> That matches the legal framework referenced in period court
discussions (e.g., <em>Smith v. Turner</em>, 1849) about New York’s marine hospital and quarantine authority. (<a href="https://www.cshwhalingmuseum.org/blog/the-history-of-quarantine-in-new-york-harbor-and-long-island?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="The HISTORY OF Quarantine in New York Harbor and ...">THE
WHALING MUSEUM</a>)</p>
<p>Also, <strong>Castle Garden did not open as an immigrant landing/processing depot until August 3, 1855</strong>, i.e., several
years after your ancestors’ 1849–1850 arrivals—so their ships would have cleared Staten Island Quarantine and then
docked at Manhattan piers (typically the East River) rather than landing at Castle Garden. (<a href="https://www.nps.gov/cacl/learn/historyculture/castle-garden-emigrant-depot.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Castle Garden Emigrant Depot">National Park
Service</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> For arrivals from Bremerhaven in <strong>1849–1850</strong>, you can safely infer <strong>Staten Island Quarantine first</strong>, followed by docking at a Manhattan wharf.</p>
<p>So if your ancestors came in <strong>1849–1850</strong> , they likely cleared <strong>Staten Island Quarantine</strong> and then <strong>walked off
at a Manhattan pier</strong>, not by tender at Castle Garden.</p>
<p>What actually happened then:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quarantine first.</strong> Arriving ships anchored off <strong>Staten Island’s Marine Hospital (the Quarantine)</strong>, where
health officers boarded for inspection. Only after clearance could a ship proceed toward Manhattan. (<a href="https://lighthousemuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matt-Connor-Quarantine-NY-Article-555KBwecompress.com_.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Quarantine in New York: A Historical Context">Lighthouse Museum</a>)</li>
<li><strong>No central immigration station yet.</strong> <strong>Castle Garden wasn’t an immigrant depot until August 3, 1855</strong>; before
that, it was an entertainment venue. So in 1849–1850 there was <strong>no landing at Castle Garden for processing</strong>. (<a href="https://www.cshwhalingmuseum.org/blog/the-history-of-quarantine-in-new-york-harbor-and-long-island?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="The HISTORY OF Quarantine in New York Harbor and ...">National Park Service</a>)</li>
<li><strong>They docked at Manhattan piers (mostly South Street on the East River).</strong> After quarantine, packet ships
typically <strong>tied up at the South Street Seaport piers</strong> (or nearby East River wharves), and passengers <strong>walked
off onto the wharf</strong>; ship agents handled any onward arrangements. Tendering was only used when circumstances
required, not as a standard practice at Castle Garden. (<a href="https://www.nps.gov/cacl/learn/historyculture/castle-garden-emigrant-depot.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Castle Garden Emigrant Depot">South Street Seaport Museum</a>)</li>
<li><strong>“From Bremen” usually meant Bremerhaven.</strong> Most Bremen sailings actually embarked at <strong>Bremerhaven</strong> (the
outport on the Weser), though U.S. lists often just say “Bremen.” (<a href="https://www.ggarchives.com/OceanTravel/Passengers/Ports/Bremen-PassengerLists.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Bremen Passenger Lists 1881-1951">GG Archives</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>So for your ancestors in <strong>1849–1850</strong>: cleared quarantine off <strong>Staten Island</strong>, then <strong>docked at Manhattan (South
Street/East River)</strong> and disembarked there—not by small boats from Castle Garden.</p>
<h3>Articles to Consult about Ship Arrivals in NYC</h3>
<p>Yes—there are several solid, readable pieces that explain how arrivals worked <strong>before 1855</strong> (i.e., quarantine off Staten Island, then docking at Manhattan piers rather than Castle Garden). Here are good starting points:</p>

<li>
<p><strong>NPS history on Castle Garden’s start (context for the “pre-” era):</strong> concise background that Castle Garden opened
<strong>Aug. 3, 1855</strong>, so anything earlier followed the older practice outside Castle Garden.

<p>If you want to get <strong>pier-level detail</strong> for a specific voyage (e.g., your ship in 1849/1850), pair the exact
arrival date + ship name with <strong>New York newspaper “Shipping News”</strong> columns—those often name the <strong>agent and
wharf</strong>. The South Street Seaport Museum’s pieces give context for where to expect those wharves. (<a href="https://www.cshwhalingmuseum.org/blog/the-history-of-quarantine-in-new-york-harbor-and-long-island?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="The HISTORY OF Quarantine in New York Harbor and ...">South Street
Seaport Museum</a>)</p>
<p>Happy to chase your ancestors’ <strong>ship + date</strong> in historical newspapers and pull the likely <strong>pier/agent</strong> for you.</p>
<h2>Strategy for Finding the Arrival Pier</h2>
<p>In the late-1840s/1850s New York papers ran daily “Ship/Marine” columns—often titled <strong>Ship News</strong>, <strong>Shipping Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Marine Intelligence</strong>, or <strong>Marine Journal</strong>. Titles that regularly carried these columns included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New York Herald</strong> (daily). A core paper for harbor reports. (<a href="https://lighthousemuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matt-Connor-Quarantine-NY-Article-555KBwecompress.com_.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Quarantine in New York: A Historical Context">New York State Library</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Journal of Commerce</strong> (daily). A leading commercial sheet; central to marine reporting. (<a href="https://lighthousemuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matt-Connor-Quarantine-NY-Article-555KBwecompress.com_.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Quarantine in New York: A Historical Context">New York State Library</a>)</li>
<li><strong>New-York Tribune</strong> (daily). Ran a <strong>“Marine Intelligence”</strong> section. (<a href="https://www.cshwhalingmuseum.org/blog/the-history-of-quarantine-in-new-york-harbor-and-long-island?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="The HISTORY OF Quarantine in New York Harbor and ...">NYPL LibGuides</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Evening Post</strong> (daily). Pages labeled <strong>“Marine Intelligence.”</strong> (<a href="https://www.nps.gov/cacl/learn/historyculture/castle-garden-emigrant-depot.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Castle Garden Emigrant Depot">Newspapers</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Courier &amp; Enquirer</strong> (daily). Another harbor-heavy commercial daily. (<a href="https://lighthousemuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matt-Connor-Quarantine-NY-Article-555KBwecompress.com_.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Quarantine in New York: A Historical Context">New York State Library</a>)</li>
<li><strong>New York Express</strong> (daily). Part of the same harbor-news ecosystem. (<a href="https://www.ggarchives.com/OceanTravel/Passengers/Ports/Bremen-PassengerLists.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Bremen Passenger Lists 1881-1951">WorldCat</a>)</li>
<li><strong>New-York Daily Times</strong> (from Sept 1851; later the New York Times) also carried <strong>Marine Intelligence</strong>. (<a href="https://www.gothamcenter.org/blog/quarantinestatenisland-zy4la-6h6h4-tlwga-allfs-5gpbn-p8hkk-gewm2-86weg-453lp-rtg9j-b4nt8-f2n45-2s22f-kmea4-5jtmm-a2l5n-ljflg-bbjh6-82t6p-w9slx-nhf8r-egskg?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Quarantine Scenes in Staten Island History">Wikisource</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Handy tip: librarians note the <strong>column name varies by paper</strong>—so search for any of the headings above. (<a href="https://www.newyorkfamilyhistory.org/subject-guide/new-york-immigration-records-online?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="New York Immigration Records Online">NYPL LibGuides</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Where to read them online (often free with a library card):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NYPL</strong> guides/databases (great entry points to digitized NYC papers). (<a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/blog/ny-castle-garden-ellis-island?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Castle Garden: Immigration Before Ellis Island">NYPL LibGuides</a>)</li>
<li><strong>NYS Historic Newspapers</strong> (indexes many New York titles). (<a href="https://www.nypl.org/collections/articles-databases/nys-historic-newspapers?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="NYS Historic Newspapers">NYPL</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Search strategy: use the <strong>ship name + exact arrival date</strong> and check the <strong>day of arrival and the next 1–2 days</strong> in the papers above; look under sections “Arrived,” “Cleared,” and “Advertisements” (agents often list <strong>regular berth/pier</strong> there). The <strong>Harbor (Marine) News Association</strong> coordinated ship reports among the Herald, Sun, Journal of Commerce, Courier &amp; Enquirer, Express, and Tribune—so the same ship info often appears across multiple titles. (<a href="https://www.ggarchives.com/OceanTravel/Passengers/Ports/Bremen-PassengerLists.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Bremen Passenger Lists 1881-1951">WorldCat</a>)</p>
<p>If you share your ship name and date, I can pull likely <strong>agent + wharf/pier</strong> hits from those columns.</p>
