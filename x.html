<p>The Orion manifest header is very helpful. It confirms several key
points about the <strong>bark <em>Orion</em></strong> voyage that
brought your ancestor’s family to New York on <strong>5 November
1849</strong>:</p>
<h2 id="what-the-manifest-shows">1. What the manifest shows</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master:</strong> <em>F. Schwartze</em> (his signature is
visible at bottom right).</li>
<li><strong>Ship:</strong> <em>Orion</em>, a <strong>bark</strong>
(barque) — a common type of Bremen packet ship.</li>
<li><strong>Burthen (tonnage):</strong> 333 tons.</li>
<li><strong>Port of departure:</strong> <em>Bremen</em> (meaning
Bremerhaven).</li>
<li><strong>Arrival port:</strong> <em>New York</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That fits the Bremen–New York packet trade precisely.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-implies-about-the-arrival-process">2. What this
implies about the arrival process</h2>
<p>Given the <strong>date (Nov 1849)</strong> and <strong>origin
(Bremen)</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Quarantine:</strong> All vessels arriving from foreign ports
were <em>required</em> to anchor off the <strong>Staten Island Marine
Hospital (the “Quarantine”)</strong> for health inspection. This was
automatic for every transatlantic passenger vessel in that decade.</li>
<li><strong>After clearance:</strong> The <em>Orion</em> would then have
been allowed to sail up to <strong>Manhattan’s East River
wharves</strong>, most likely along <strong>South Street</strong> near
<strong>Catherine Slip, Pike Slip, or Burling Slip</strong>, where
Bremen packet agents maintained berths.</li>
<li><strong>Landing:</strong> Passengers simply walked down the gangway
to the wharf—<strong>no tenders, no Castle Garden</strong> (which did
not open until 1855).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-locate-the-exact-wharf-or-agent">3. How to locate the
exact wharf or agent</h2>
<p>Because <em>F. Schwartze</em> captained the <em>Orion</em>, you can
now:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Search <strong>New York Herald</strong>, <strong>New York Journal
of Commerce</strong>, <strong>Evening Post</strong>, or <strong>New-York
(Daily?) Tribune</strong> issues dated <strong>5–7 November
1849</strong> in their <em>Ship News</em> or <em>Marine
Intelligence</em> columns. Look for an entry like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bark <em>Orion</em>, Schwartze, from Bremen — agent [Name], arrived
[date].” The line sometimes includes the <strong>pier or street (e.g.,
“South St., foot of Pike Slip”)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Bremen packet-line ads in those same papers often list the
<strong>regular berth</strong> and the <strong>New York agent’s
name</strong> (commonly <strong>J. F. D. Schroeder</strong>, <strong>C.
W. Habicht</strong>, or <strong>Oelrichs &amp; Co.</strong> in that
era).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you like, I can suggest the <strong>exact newspaper database
links</strong> (NY Herald, <em>Journal of Commerce</em>, etc.) and the
most efficient search string to use for <em>Orion Schwartze Bremen
November 1849</em>. Would you like me to do that next?</p>
<p>Great—here’s a tight, do-this list to find the <strong>bark
<em>Orion</em>, Capt. F. Schwartze, arr. 5 Nov 1849</strong> in NYC
“Marine/Ship News” and (ideally) the <strong>agent/wharf</strong>.</p>

<li><p><strong>What to extract:</strong> the line that looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>Bk. Orion, Schwartze, from Bremen</strong> … to
[<strong>agent</strong>], [<strong>South St. (wharf/slip)</strong>].” If
the wharf isn’t in the arrivals list, check <strong>ads</strong> the
same week for the Bremen packet line—they often state the
<strong>regular berth</strong> (e.g., “foot of Pike Slip, South
St.”).</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="bonus-targets-if-needed">Bonus targets (if needed)</h2>

<li>If the daily doesn’t show it, try the <strong>commercial
