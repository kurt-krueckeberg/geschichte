# Find the Orion Arrival Pier

See (https://chatgpt.com/c/68f25994-f068-8327-8dc4-ec0f7c016f46)[this chat] for the infor below

The Orion manifest header is very helpful. It confirms several key points about the **bark *Orion*** voyage that
brought your ancestor‚Äôs family to New York on **5 November 1849**:

## 1. What the manifest shows

* **Master:** *F. Schwartze* (his signature is visible at bottom right).
* **Ship:** *Orion*, a **bark** (barque) ‚Äî a common type of Bremen packet ship.
* **Burthen (tonnage):** 333 tons.
* **Port of departure:** *Bremen* (meaning Bremerhaven).
* **Arrival port:** *New York*.

That fits the Bremen‚ÄìNew York packet trade precisely.

## 2. What this implies about the arrival process

Given the **date (Nov 1849)** and **origin (Bremen)**:

1. **Quarantine:** All vessels arriving from foreign ports were *required* to anchor off the **Staten Island Marine
   Hospital (the ‚ÄúQuarantine‚Äù)** for health inspection. This was automatic for every transatlantic passenger vessel
   in that decade.
2. **After clearance:** The *Orion* would then have been allowed to sail up to **Manhattan‚Äôs East River wharves**,
   most likely along **South Street** near **Catherine Slip, Pike Slip, or Burling Slip**, where Bremen packet
  agents maintained berths.
3. **Landing:** Passengers simply walked down the gangway to the wharf‚Äî**no tenders, no Castle Garden** (which did
   not open until 1855).

## 3. How to locate the exact wharf or agent

Because *F. Schwartze* captained the *Orion*, you can now:

* Search **New York Herald**, **New York Journal of Commerce**, **Evening Post**, or **New-York (Daily?) Tribune** issues dated **5‚Äì7
  November 1849** in their *Ship News* or *Marine Intelligence* columns.  Look for an entry like:

  > ‚ÄúBark *Orion*, Schwartze, from Bremen ‚Äî agent [Name], arrived [date].‚Äù
  > The line sometimes includes the **pier or street (e.g., ‚ÄúSouth St., foot of Pike Slip‚Äù)**.
* Bremen packet-line ads in those same papers often list the **regular berth** and the **New York agent‚Äôs name**
  (commonly **J. F. D. Schroeder**, **C. W. Habicht**, or **Oelrichs & Co.** in that era).

If you like, I can suggest the **exact newspaper database links** (NY Herald, *Journal of Commerce*, etc.) and the
most efficient search string to use for *Orion Schwartze Bremen November 1849*. Would you like me to do that next?


Great‚Äîhere‚Äôs a tight, do-this list to find the **bark *Orion*, Capt. F. Schwartze, arr. 5 Nov 1849** in NYC ‚ÄúMarine/Ship News‚Äù and (ideally) the **agent/wharf**.

## Where to search (with direct sources)

* **New-York Daily/ Semi-Weekly Tribune (free)** ‚Äî full 1840s runs; look for the **‚ÄúMarine Intelligence‚Äù** column. ([The Library of Congress][1])
* **The Evening Post (free)** ‚Äî browse 1849; has **‚ÄúMarine Intelligence‚Äù** on page 1. ([New York State Historic Newspapers][2])
* **Fulton History (‚ÄúOld Fulton NY Post Cards‚Äù)** ‚Äî huge NY newspaper trove; includes many NYC titles and often the **Herald**. Use advanced search; OCR is quirky but powerful. ([FamilySearch][3])
* **Newspapers.com** ‚Äî has **New York Herald** (but their digitized run starts later; still useful for **Evening Post** and others). ([Newspapers][4])
* **NYPL guide to NYC newspapers online** ‚Äî handy jumping-off page that links to multiple digital resources. ([NYPL LibGuides][5])

## Exactly what to do

1. **Date window:** check **5‚Äì7 Nov 1849** (arrival day and 1‚Äì2 days after).
2. **Headings to open:** *Marine Intelligence*, *Ship/Shipping News*, *Marine Journal*.
3. **Search strings (verbatim):**

   * `"Orion" Schwartze Bremen`
   * `"Bark Orion" Bremen`
   * `Schwartze Bremen`
   * If search is fussy, try just `Orion` and scan the Marine column manually.
4. **What to extract:** the line that looks like:

   * ‚Äú**Bk. Orion, Schwartze, from Bremen** ‚Ä¶ to [**agent**], [**South St. (wharf/slip)**].‚Äù
     If the wharf isn‚Äôt in the arrivals list, check **ads** the same week for the Bremen packet line‚Äîthey often state the **regular berth** (e.g., ‚Äúfoot of Pike Slip, South St.‚Äù).

## Bonus targets (if needed)

* If the daily  general-circulation newspapers such as the New-York Daily Tribune, the New York Herald, or the New York Evening Post,
  don‚Äôt show it, try the **commercial sheets** (often stronger on agent/berth notes): **Journal of
  Commerce** (library or index pages to locate issues/copies). ([icon.crl.edu][6])

If you want, tell me which of the sites above you can access (NYPL card, Newspapers.com, etc.). I‚Äôll give you a
copy-paste query for that site and the **exact issue dates/pages** to open first for the *Orion* note.
