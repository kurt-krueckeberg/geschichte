Excellent — this image header is very helpful. It confirms several key points about the **bark *Orion*** voyage that brought your ancestor’s family to New York on **5 November 1849**:

### 1. What the manifest shows

* **Master:** *F. Schwartze* (his signature is visible at bottom right).
* **Ship:** *Orion*, a **bark** (barque) — a common type of Bremen packet ship.
* **Burthen (tonnage):** 333 tons.
* **Port of departure:** *Bremen* (meaning Bremerhaven).
* **Arrival port:** *New York*.

That fits the Bremen–New York packet trade precisely.

### 2. What this implies about the arrival process

Given the **date (Nov 1849)** and **origin (Bremen)**:

1. **Quarantine:** All vessels arriving from foreign ports were *required* to anchor off the **Staten Island Marine Hospital (the “Quarantine”)** for health inspection. This was automatic for every transatlantic passenger vessel in that decade.
2. **After clearance:** The *Orion* would then have been allowed to sail up to **Manhattan’s East River wharves**, most likely along **South Street** near **Catherine Slip, Pike Slip, or Burling Slip**, where Bremen packet agents maintained berths.
3. **Landing:** Passengers simply walked down the gangway to the wharf—**no tenders, no Castle Garden** (which did not open until 1855).

### 3. How to locate the exact wharf or agent

Because *F. Schwartze* captained the *Orion*, you can now:

* Search **New York Herald**, **Journal of Commerce**, **Evening Post**, or **New-York Tribune** issues dated **5–7 November 1849** in their *Ship News* or *Marine Intelligence* columns.
  Look for an entry like:

  > “Bark *Orion*, Schwartze, from Bremen — agent [Name], arrived [date].”
  > The line sometimes includes the **pier or street (e.g., “South St., foot of Pike Slip”)**.
* Bremen packet-line ads in those same papers often list the **regular berth** and the **New York agent’s name** (commonly **J. F. D. Schroeder**, **C. W. Habicht**, or **Oelrichs & Co.** in that era).

If you like, I can suggest the **exact newspaper database links** (NY Herald, *Journal of Commerce*, etc.) and the most efficient search string to use for *Orion Schwartze Bremen November 1849*. Would you like me to do that next?
