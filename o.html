<p>Excellent — this image header is very helpful. It confirms several key points about the <strong>bark <em>Orion</em></strong> voyage that brought your ancestor’s family to New York on <strong>5 November 1849</strong>:</p>
<h3>1. What the manifest shows</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master:</strong> <em>F. Schwartze</em> (his signature is visible at bottom right).</li>
<li><strong>Ship:</strong> <em>Orion</em>, a <strong>bark</strong> (barque) — a common type of Bremen packet ship.</li>
<li><strong>Burthen (tonnage):</strong> 333 tons.</li>
<li><strong>Port of departure:</strong> <em>Bremen</em> (meaning Bremerhaven).</li>
<li><strong>Arrival port:</strong> <em>New York</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That fits the Bremen–New York packet trade precisely.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. What this implies about the arrival process</h3>
<p>Given the <strong>date (Nov 1849)</strong> and <strong>origin (Bremen)</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quarantine:</strong> All vessels arriving from foreign ports were <em>required</em> to anchor off the <strong>Staten Island Marine Hospital (the “Quarantine”)</strong> for health inspection. This was automatic for every transatlantic passenger vessel in that decade.</li>
<li><strong>After clearance:</strong> The <em>Orion</em> would then have been allowed to sail up to <strong>Manhattan’s East River wharves</strong>, most likely along <strong>South Street</strong> near <strong>Catherine Slip, Pike Slip, or Burling Slip</strong>, where Bremen packet agents maintained berths.</li>
<li><strong>Landing:</strong> Passengers simply walked down the gangway to the wharf—<strong>no tenders, no Castle Garden</strong> (which did not open until 1855).</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>3. How to locate the exact wharf or agent</h3>
<p>Because <em>F. Schwartze</em> captained the <em>Orion</em>, you can now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Search <strong>New York Herald</strong>, <strong>Journal of Commerce</strong>, <strong>Evening Post</strong>, or <strong>New-York Tribune</strong> issues dated <strong>5–7 November 1849</strong> in their <em>Ship News</em> or <em>Marine Intelligence</em> columns.
Look for an entry like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bark <em>Orion</em>, Schwartze, from Bremen — agent [Name], arrived [date].”
The line sometimes includes the <strong>pier or street (e.g., “South St., foot of Pike Slip”)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bremen packet-line ads in those same papers often list the <strong>regular berth</strong> and the <strong>New York agent’s name</strong> (commonly <strong>J. F. D. Schroeder</strong>, <strong>C. W. Habicht</strong>, or <strong>Oelrichs &amp; Co.</strong> in that era).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you like, I can suggest the <strong>exact newspaper database links</strong> (NY Herald, <em>Journal of Commerce</em>, etc.) and the most efficient search string to use for <em>Orion Schwartze Bremen November 1849</em>. Would you like me to do that next?</p>
