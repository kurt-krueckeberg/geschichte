# Immigrant Ship Arrivals Prior to 1855

## Arrival Place and Process pre-1855

**Castle Garden (Castle Clinton) didn’t become an immigration depot until August 3, 1855.** So arrivals in
**1849–1850** were **not processed or landed at Castle Garden**. ([National Park Service][1])

In that period, ships **first stopped at the Staten Island Marine Hospital (the Quarantine)** for inspection,
then—once cleared—**proceeded to Manhattan piers**, especially along **South Street on the East River**, where
passengers disembarked directly to the wharf. ([Wikipedia][2])

Yes—**as a rule in 1849–1850, all ocean-arriving vessels were required to stop at the Staten Island Quarantine for
health inspection** before proceeding to Manhattan. New York’s quarantine system had been in place since 1799 at
the **New York Marine Hospital** (“the Quarantine”) on Staten Island, and by the mid-19th century ships from
foreign ports were inspected there as a matter of law and practice. ([National Lighthouse Museum][1])

A concise summary from a museum history notes that **“by 1846 all ships coming into New York Harbor had to anchor
off near Staten Island for quarantine inspection.”** That matches the legal framework referenced in period court
discussions (e.g., *Smith v. Turner*, 1849) about New York’s marine hospital and quarantine authority. ([THE
WHALING MUSEUM][2])

Also, **Castle Garden did not open as an immigrant landing/processing depot until August 3, 1855**, i.e., several
years after your ancestors’ 1849–1850 arrivals—so their ships would have cleared Staten Island Quarantine and then
docked at Manhattan piers (typically the East River) rather than landing at Castle Garden. ([National Park
Service][3])

**Bottom line:** For arrivals from Bremerhaven in **1849–1850**, you can safely infer **Staten Island Quarantine first**, followed by docking at a Manhattan wharf.

So if your ancestors came in **1849–1850** , they likely cleared **Staten Island Quarantine** and then **walked off
at a Manhattan pier**, not by tender at Castle Garden.

What actually happened then:

* **Quarantine first.** Arriving ships anchored off **Staten Island’s Marine Hospital (the Quarantine)**, where
  health officers boarded for inspection. Only after clearance could a ship proceed toward Manhattan. ([Lighthouse Museum][1])
* **No central immigration station yet.** **Castle Garden wasn’t an immigrant depot until August 3, 1855**; before
  that, it was an entertainment venue. So in 1849–1850 there was **no landing at Castle Garden for processing**. ([National Park Service][2])
* **They docked at Manhattan piers (mostly South Street on the East River).** After quarantine, packet ships
  typically **tied up at the South Street Seaport piers** (or nearby East River wharves), and passengers **walked
  off onto the wharf**; ship agents handled any onward arrangements. Tendering was only used when circumstances
  required, not as a standard practice at Castle Garden. ([South Street Seaport Museum][3])
* **“From Bremen” usually meant Bremerhaven.** Most Bremen sailings actually embarked at **Bremerhaven** (the
  outport on the Weser), though U.S. lists often just say “Bremen.” ([GG Archives][4])

So for your ancestors in **1849–1850**: cleared quarantine off **Staten Island**, then **docked at Manhattan (South
Street/East River)** and disembarked there—not by small boats from Castle Garden.

### Articles to Consult about Ship Arrivals in NYC

Yes—there are several solid, readable pieces that explain how arrivals worked **before 1855** (i.e., quarantine off Staten Island, then docking at Manhattan piers rather than Castle Garden). Here are good starting points:

* **NPS history on Castle Garden’s start (context for the “pre-” era):** concise background that Castle Garden opened
  **Aug. 3, 1855**, so anything earlier followed the older practice outside Castle Garden. ([NPS History][1])
* **South Street Seaport Museum (where ships actually tied up):** short histories confirming South Street/East River
  as New York’s principal seaport through the mid-19th century. ([South Street Seaport Museum][2])
* **Quarantine overviews (Staten Island Marine Hospital):**

  * CSH Whaling Museum blog: plain-English summary that by **1846 all ships** anchored off Staten Island for inspection. ([THE WHALING MUSEUM][3])
  * National Lighthouse Museum paper (PDF): history of the **Tompkinsville Quarantine** (opened 1799) and later facilities. ([National Lighthouse Museum][4])
  * Gotham Center blog essay (2025): narrative history of the Staten Island Quarantine and the 1858 destruction—useful for context. ([Gotham Center][5])
* **Genealogist-oriented guides:**

  * **NYG&B** “New York Immigration Records Online” (with references to deeper guides covering the **pre-Castle Garden**
    period). ([New York Family History][6])
  * **FamilySearch** overview of Castle Garden/Ellis Island records (helps frame what exists for **pre-1855** and after).
    ([FamilySearch][7])

If you want to get **pier-level detail** for a specific voyage (e.g., your ship in 1849/1850), pair the exact
arrival date + ship name with **New York newspaper “Shipping News”** columns—those often name the **agent and
wharf**. The South Street Seaport Museum’s pieces give context for where to expect those wharves. ([South Street
Seaport Museum][2])

Happy to chase your ancestors’ **ship + date** in historical newspapers and pull the likely **pier/agent** for you.

### Strategy for Finding the Arrival Pier

In the late-1840s/1850s New York papers ran daily “Ship/Marine” columns—often titled **Ship News**, **Shipping Intelligence**, **Marine Intelligence**, or **Marine Journal**. Titles that regularly carried these columns included:

* **New York Herald** (daily). A core paper for harbor reports. ([New York State Library][1])
* **Journal of Commerce** (daily). A leading commercial sheet; central to marine reporting. ([New York State Library][1])
* **New-York Tribune** (daily). Ran a **“Marine Intelligence”** section. ([NYPL LibGuides][2])
* **Evening Post** (daily). Pages labeled **“Marine Intelligence.”** ([Newspapers][3])
* **Courier & Enquirer** (daily). Another harbor-heavy commercial daily. ([New York State Library][1])
* **New York Express** (daily). Part of the same harbor-news ecosystem. ([WorldCat][4])
* **New-York Daily Times** (from Sept 1851; later the New York Times) also carried **Marine Intelligence**. ([Wikisource][5])

Handy tip: librarians note the **column name varies by paper**—so search for any of the headings above. ([NYPL LibGuides][6])

**Where to read them online (often free with a library card):**

* **NYPL** guides/databases (great entry points to digitized NYC papers). ([NYPL LibGuides][7])
* **NYS Historic Newspapers** (indexes many New York titles). ([NYPL][8])

Search strategy: use the **ship name + exact arrival date** and check the **day of arrival and the next 1–2 days** in the papers above; look under sections “Arrived,” “Cleared,” and “Advertisements” (agents often list **regular berth/pier** there). The **Harbor (Marine) News Association** coordinated ship reports among the Herald, Sun, Journal of Commerce, Courier & Enquirer, Express, and Tribune—so the same ship info often appears across multiple titles. ([WorldCat][4])

If you share your ship name and date, I can pull likely **agent + wharf/pier** hits from those columns.

### Finding the 5 November 1849 Arrival Pier for Bark Orion

The Orion manifest header is very helpful. It confirms several key points about the **bark *Orion*** voyage that
brought your ancestor’s family to New York on **5 November 1849**:

#### 1. What the manifest shows

* **Master:** *F. Schwartze* (his signature is visible at bottom right).
* **Ship:** *Orion*, a **bark** (barque) — a common type of Bremen packet ship.
* **Burthen (tonnage):** 333 tons.
* **Port of departure:** *Bremen* (meaning Bremerhaven).
* **Arrival port:** *New York*.

That fits the Bremen–New York packet trade precisely.

#### 2. What this implies about the arrival process

Given the **date (Nov 1849)** and **origin (Bremen)**:

1. **Quarantine:** All vessels arriving from foreign ports were *required* to anchor off the **Staten Island Marine Hospital (the “Quarantine”)** for health inspection. This was automatic for every transatlantic passenger vessel in that decade.
2. **After clearance:** The *Orion* would then have been allowed to sail up to **Manhattan’s East River wharves**, most likely along **South Street** near **Catherine Slip, Pike Slip, or Burling Slip**, where Bremen packet agents maintained berths.
3. **Landing:** Passengers simply walked down the gangway to the wharf—**no tenders, no Castle Garden** (which did not open until 1855).

#### 3. How to locate the exact wharf or agent

Because *F. Schwartze* captained the *Orion*, you can now:

* Search **New York Herald**, **Journal of Commerce**, **Evening Post**, or **New-York Tribune** issues dated **5–7 November 1849** in their *Ship News* or *Marine Intelligence* columns.
  Look for an entry like:

  > “Bark *Orion*, Schwartze, from Bremen — agent [Name], arrived [date].”
  > The line sometimes includes the **pier or street (e.g., “South St., foot of Pike Slip”)**.
* Bremen packet-line ads in those same papers often list the **regular berth** and the **New York agent’s name** (commonly **J. F. D. Schroeder**, **C. W. Habicht**, or **Oelrichs & Co.** in that era).

If you like, I can suggest the **exact newspaper database links** (NY Herald, *Journal of Commerce*, etc.) and the most efficient search string to use for *Orion Schwartze Bremen November 1849*. Would you like me to do that next?
